    <h1>Squelch Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>This will require a synthesizer with a coarse pitch control, and at least 2 bandpass filters that can operate in parallel.</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>1. Start with a harmonically rich soundwave - generally a sawtooth wave because it contains every overtone, with a slow volume decay for each overtone.</ol>
        <ol>2. Create two bandpass filters in parallel - automating these around in space will create a formant sound</ol>
        <ol>3. Pitchbend the source wave form in conjunction with filter movement for the iconic squelch sound.</ol>
