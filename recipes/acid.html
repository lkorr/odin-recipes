    <h1>Acid Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul> This will require a subtractive synthesizer, with a lowpass filter with resonance and cutoff filter controls</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>1. Start with a harmonically rich soundwave - generally a sawtooth wave because it contains every overtone, with a slow volume decay for each overtone.</ol>
        <ol>2. Apply a lowpass filter, with the cutoff assigned to the envelope.</ol>
        <ol>3. Increase resonance of the lowpass cutoff to taste, with some release to hear filter movement.</ol>
